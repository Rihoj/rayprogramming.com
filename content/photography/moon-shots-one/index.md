I think today's photography post will be focused on just sharing the images. These were all taken with the following specs by my wife.

- Camera: [Charlie](/notes/cameras)
- Lens: [Canon Zoom EF Lens](/notes/cameras)

Next week I am going to work on presenting some of the photos I have taken myself. I am also going to work on logging some of these things a bit better when I take the photos, but I need to find a good way to do so while outside. I don't want to take my laptop out there and lose the experience, but I think pen and paper would be even worse.
