I think today's photography post will be focused on just sharing the images. These were all taken with the following specs. I am not sure what else I had used.

- Camera: [Pixel 3a XL](/notes/cameras)
- Scope: [Wayne](/notes/telescopes/)

I am going to try logging some of these things a bit better, but I need to find a good way to do so while outside. I don't want to take my laptop out there and lose the experience, but I think pen and paper would be even worse.

I am tempted to see about cropping these and editing them further, but I am not sure if it is worth it at this time.
