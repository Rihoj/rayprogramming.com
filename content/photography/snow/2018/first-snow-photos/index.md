### Preface
Now, these photos are not great quality. I took them years ago (2018), and I don't remember why they are so low quality. But they are my first ones, and I wanted to share anyways.

### Dogwood
This dogwood tree was planted outside our house years ago by our landlord. To my understanding it was one of the mother's day gift he had given her. It flowers in the spring are rather beautiful, but I don't think they compare to how it looks with snow and ice on it.

### Pines
These pines are a pain to mow around, but when they are covered with snow they can make you think of an artistic rendering of snow peaked mountains. I love how strong they look even while the snow weighs them down and draws the normal upturned branches down towards the ground. It gives them a lengthy feeling to them that just makes them seem even more massive.
