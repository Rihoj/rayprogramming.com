### Well... so much for plans
The best laid plans always seem to fail. Especially when you life is pivoting against the norm. Recently I made the decision that I needed to pursue some new pursits. This was helped by a friend of mine sharing a job posting sure, but it felt right. Usually I am scared to make decisions like this, or to even contemplate them. However, as I said, this just felt right. I applied, and sure enough they got me into an interview QUICK. I think it took less than a week. Within two weeks I had received an offer, and I quickly accepted it. I now have the job title of Senior Development/Operations Systems Engineer. Big long fancy title for, I the DevOps guy. YAY! My job will be to solely focus on how to optimize flows and manage the infrastructure for our developers.

During this time I will have to quickly come up to speed on the code and current infrastructure and start making suggestions on what can be done so that we can keep moving forward.

### What does this mean for the blog?
It's not going anywhere. I still plan on posting to it when I can, but honestly, I am not sure what I want to talk about. Everything seems to be covered anymore. But as I come across things, devops or not, I will throw something up. I can't promise a schedule right now as I can't garuntee that I will be able to find content every week that I really want to discuss.
